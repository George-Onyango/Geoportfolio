I want to create a job opportunity for myself and others.That's my plan so help me GOD.This is why I took moringa school classes not only does the institution have the best facilities in the programming world in Kenya but also the name itself is quite renounsed and an amazing staff to compliment it's already high standard rapport.I plan to start a working website by 20th birthday and hope to make a stable company that can create jobs for people 4 to 5 years down the line.To become a mentor to people is an honor I want to be blessed within years to come. </p>
