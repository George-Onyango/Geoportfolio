            <p>I am a 19yr old coder I like to call myself.I was born out of state but grew up in Kenya.So it's my cradle land.I studied my pre-school and and primary at St.Hannah's preparatory along ngong road.My high school was Homabay school.I facncy myself a student for now with no job experience physically,but I've done a few here and there as a freelancer online.My long term plan is change the country economy doesn't have to be nationally but even locally. I want to create a job opportunity for myself and others.That's my plan so help me GOD.This is why I took moringa school classes not only does the institution have the best facilities in the programming world in Kenya but also the name itself is quite renounsed and an amazing staff to compliment it's already high standard rapport.I plan to start a working website by 20th birthday and hope to make a stable company that can create jobs for people 4 to 5 years down the line.To become a mentor to people is an honor I want to be blessed within years to come. </p>
